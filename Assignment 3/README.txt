Hello Professor,



Here's an outline of the contents of this folder.

1. The Writeup. Here is the lovely writeup of my research.
2. My assignment files. part_1 - 3.c. To build then type make part1, make part2, or make part3, this will create the programs.
3. The folder stats_hw contains some java code I wrote to calculate averages for my data and some thing like that.

That's pretty much it. Enjoy.
