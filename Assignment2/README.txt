Hello Professor Matthews,

I have been doing much of the work for this project in windows, and when running tests via cygwin
I've notice some slightly strange behavior. Some of the numbers are slightly different. It is too late to head
to the computer labs and change them tonight (11:30 pm Friday), but I would like to go in tomorrow morning
and fix this. The program still runs mostly correct, just in certain cases the number 8 gets turned into a 1.
It's strange. Anyway, if you see an update from Saturday morningish, that is why.
