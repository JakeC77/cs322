This is my submission for Assignment 5. To compile and run, use the following commands:


make Semaphore for the semaphore program, it will create an obeject named Semaphore
make Conditional for the conditional program, it will create an object named Conditional

Each program takes three arguments, a number of cycles, a number of threads, and a string to be used in the buffer.

I've included .txt files with sample runs of larger numbers
