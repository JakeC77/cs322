This is my submission for Assignment 5. To compile and run, use the following commands:


make Semaphore for the semaphore program,
make Conditional for the conditional program.

Each program takes three arguments, a number of cycles, a number of threads, and a string to be used in the buffer.

I've included .txt files with sample runs of larger numbers
